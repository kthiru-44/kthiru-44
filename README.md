## Computer Science Undergraduate | Quantum Computing & Software Systems


## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student driven by a deep interest in quantum computing, backend engineering, and machine learning. I focus on mastering core fundamentals — algorithms, data structures, distributed systems, and quantum information theory — to build a strong technical base for advanced research and scalable systems.

On the engineering side, I enjoy designing robust backend architectures and developing ML models that translate theory into real-world impact. I’m particularly interested in how classical high-performance infrastructure can integrate with emerging quantum technologies.
