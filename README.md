## Computer Science Undergraduate | Quantum Computing & Software Systems

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at PES University with focused interests in quantum computing, algorithms, and software systems.  
My current work involves exploring the interface between quantum theory and computational implementation — understanding how algorithmic and physical constraints interact in real systems.

## About Me

I began my journey with IBM’s *Basics of Quantum Information* and *Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms* courses, which provided a foundation in measurement theory, circuit design, and algorithmic reasoning.  
Building on this, I document my progress through open-source projects that combine physics intuition with computational execution.
