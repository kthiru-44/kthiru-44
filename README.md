## Computer Science Undergraduate | Quantum Computing & Software Systems

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at PES University with focused interests in quantum computing, algorithms, and software systems.  
My current work involves exploring the interface between quantum theory and computational implementation — understanding how algorithmic and physical constraints interact in real systems.
