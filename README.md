Hi, I’m Thiru.

I’m an undergraduate student starting my B.Tech in Computer Science , with a deep interest in quantum computing and software systems.

Currently learning:
- Python
- Fundamentals of quantum computing (Qiskit, IBM Quantum, edX courses)
- Core mathematics: linear algebra, complex numbers, probability

My interests include:
- Quantum algorithms and simulations
- Scientific computing and open-source development
- Research-driven software tools with real-world impact

Long-term, I plan to pursue a master's in quantum or physics-tech at top universities like NUS, ETH Zurich, or UMD. I'm working toward building a strong foundation to contribute meaningfully to quantum research or product teams — and maybe start something of my own in the space.

I’ll be using this space to share my learning journey, small projects, and tools as I grow.
